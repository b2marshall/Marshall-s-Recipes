\textbf{Procedure:}
\medskip


\begin{enumerate}
\item Begin by boiling water in a large pot for the pasta. When it has come to boil, add a couple teaspoons of salt and add linguine. Stir to make sure the pasta separates. Cover. When water returns to a boil, cook for 7-9 minutes. Drain pasta. 


\medskip
\item Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt 2 tbsp of olive oil in 2 tpsb butter over medium-high heat. Saute the shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes until the shallots are transluscent ($\sim$4 minutes). Season the shrimp with salt and pepper; add them to the pan and cook until they have turned pink. Remove shrimp from pan and keep warm. 
\medskip

\item Add wine and lemon juice and bring to a boil. Add 3 tbsp of olive oil and 3 tbsp of butter. When the butter has melted, return the shrimp to the pan along with parsley and cooked pasta. 
\newline
